#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# `escript-local-exec` is a drop-in replacement for the standard erlang
# shebang line:
#
#    #!/usr/bin/env escript-local-exec
#
# use it for scripts inside a project with an `.erlang-release`
# file. when you run the scripts, they'll use the project-specified
# erlang release, regardless of what directory they're run from. useful
# for e.g. running project tasks in cron scripts without needing to
# `cd` into the project first
